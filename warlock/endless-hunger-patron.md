# Endless Hunger Patron

Your patron is a relatively young but powerful creature who lives on a star-shaped world, known for its ability to take on the qualities of other creatures it devours.

The Endless Hunger's motivations are inscrutably simple, at times seeming to be almost entirely centered around the pursuit of material pleasures such as tasty foods and a good night's rest. Honoring your patron might be as straightforward as providing offerings of fruits, cakes, and other sweets, or living in a manner befitting the entity's ideals. What some might consider lazy or slovenly, you know to be the loftiest of life's ambitions.

## Endless Hunger Features

#### Patron Spells

_Endless Hunger feature_

The magic of your otherworldly patron grants you the following benefits:

- **Bonus Spells.** When you gain warlock spell slots specified in the Endless Hunger Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells known and prepared. They count as warlock spells for you, but they don't count against the number of spells you know or can prepare.
- **Free Casting.** You can cast one of your leveled spells from the Endless Hunger Spells table without expending a spell slot. You must finish a Long Rest before you use this benefit again, unless you cast a spell of a different level.
- **Mystic Arcanum Additions.** When you choose a spell to learn using Mystic Arcanum, the following spells are added to the list of options, as long as you meet the warlock level requirements for the given spell level: _arcane sword, blade barrier, chain lightning, heroes' feast, meteor swarm, mind blank, prismatic spray, shapechange,_ and _teleport_.

##### Endless Hunger Spells

#### Curbed Appetite

_Endless Hunger feature_

Your patron's endless pursuit of sweet desserts can be channeled as magical energy. Constitution is now your warlock spellcasting ability.

#### Copy Abilities

_Endless Hunger feature_

Your patron gifts you the power to physically resemble another creature and take on their attributes. You can use your Bonus Action to touch a creature and attempt to copy their abilities. The creature makes a Constitution Saving Throw against your warlock Spell Save DC; the creature can choose to fail this Saving Throw, and they fail this save automatically if they are incapacitated or dead. On a failed Saving Throw, your creature type, walking and climbing speeds, resistances, and vulnerabilities are replaced with those of the creature, and your skin takes on the color and appearance of the creature's skin. You are immediately aware of all your new abilities, and you are considered to be a shapechanger while in this form. On a successful save, the creature is immune to your Copy Abilities feature for 24 hours, unless they choose to fail a future Saving Throw.

This transformation lasts until you use your Bonus Action to revert to your normal form, until you attempt to copy the abilities of another creature (which replaces any previously copied abilities), or until you are incapacitated or dead.

#### Astral Barrage

_6th-level Endless Hunger feature_

You have learned how to convert copied abilities into concentrated stellar energy, then release the energy from your mouth for a powerful attack. While you are transformed from using Copy Abilities, you can use your action to revert to your normal form, then make a ranged (20/60) spell attack. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage equal to 2d12 plus the copied creature's challenge rating or level.

The damage dice for this attack increases to 3d12 at 10th level, and to 4d12 at 14th level.

#### Consume

_6th-level Endless Hunger feature_

You have figured out how to ingest the magical essence from copied abilities as sustenance or magical energy. While you are transformed from using Copy Abilities, you can use your action to revert to your normal form and gain one of the following benefits of your choice:

- You regain Hit Points equal to the copied creature's Constitution score. Any Hit Points gained in this manner above your Hit Point Maximum are instead gained as Temporary Hit Points.
- You regain one expended Pact Magic spell slot.

Using your Consume feature satisfies all your food and drink requirements for the rest of the day.

#### Copy Traits

_10th-level Endless Hunger feature_

Successfully using your Copy Abilities feature additionally causes your damage immunities, condition immunities, movement speeds, and senses to be replaced with those of the target creature. You also inherit the creature's special traits (if any) for the duration of your transformation.

If the creature's traits are aided by a physical attribute, such as a pseudodragon's wings or a fish's gills, your form changes to include proportional versions of these attributes.

#### Recall Copies

_14th-level Endless Hunger feature_

You have mastered the art of copying such that you can restore the features of copied creatures from memory. You can use your Copy Abilities feature to replace your creature type, vulnerabilities, resistances, immunities, speeds, and senses with those of any creature you previously successfully copied, and inherit that creature's special traits (if any). Recalled creature copies cannot be used for your Astral Barrage or Consume features.

Additionally, whenever you copy a creature's abilities (including from memory), you decide which abilities are copied and which are not.

#### Free Form

_14th-level Endless Hunger feature_

Your Copy Abilities transformation now lasts until you use your Bonus Action to revert to your normal form or until you use your Astral Barrage or Consume features.
