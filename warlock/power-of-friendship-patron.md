# Power of Friendship Patron

Rather than swearing fealty to a single being of power, you have made a joint pact with one or more individuals in your travels in order to support each other through your synergistic magical bonds. Such a bond might be formed as a replacement for a bond being severed with your previous deity or other powerful entity, but it is no less potent than those sources of power. Once a patron has unlocked magical and otherworldly abilities, such gifts might be limited or suppressed by the loss of a patron, but the ability to tap into external power is a permanent change a warlock readily carries to the replacement source.

## Power of Friendship Features

#### Patron Spells

_1st-level Power of Friendship feature_

The magic of your otherworldly patron grants you the following benefits:

- **Bonus Spells.** You learn the _message_ cantrip if you don't already know it. Additionally, when you gain warlock spell slot levels specified in the Power of Friendship Spells table, you learn the listed spells. Each spell counts as a warlock spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of warlock spells you know.
- **Free Castings.** For each group of leveled spells available to you in the Power of Friendship Spells table, you can cast one of the listed spells without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast all spells in this manner when you finish a Long Rest.
- **Mystic Arcanum Additions.** When you choose a spell to learn using Mystic Arcanum, the following spells are added to the list of options, as long as you meet the warlock level requirements for the given spell level: _gate_, _heroes' feast_, _mind blank_, and _teleport_.

#### Friendship Bond

_1st-level Power of Friendship feature_

You can invite willing creatures to join your pact of friendship. To do so, you can perform a special ritual for a one-hour period targeting yourself plus up to two willing creatures who remain within 10 feet of you during the entire ritual. At the end of the ritual, the targets become bonded through your warlock magic in a friendship bond rite.

Creatures bonded to each other in this manner gain a +1 to all Saving Throws they make while they can see you. You also gain the ability to tap into the power of your bonded patrons. While you are within 30 feet of a bonded creature, you can expend a warlock spell slot to either borrow one of their abilities (no Action required), or to cast a spell the bonded creature knows or has prepared using the spell's normal casting time, which is considered a warlock spell for you when you cast it in this manner. You cannot use this feature if you do not have a warlock spell slot available.

A borrowed ability can be any feature or trait the bonded creature possesses except for Spellcasting, a warlock class feature, or any other feature or trait you already possess. Borrowed abilities are considered warlock class features for you. Abilities that assume having a prior ability can only be borrowed if you also have the prior ability; for example, you cannot borrow Beast Spells from a druid if you do not already possess a druid's Wild Shape feature. Borrowed abilities with effects that scale by level act as if you are of the minimum level required for the ability; for example, borrowing a druid's Wild Shape allows you to to take the shape of beasts with a challenge rating of Â¼ or lower.

You possess a number of friendship bond points equal to your warlock level that are used to determine what abilities with level requirements you can borrow. Borrowing such an ability costs a number of friendship bond points equal to the level requirement; for example, it costs two points to borrow a fighter's Action Surge. You cannot borrow an ability if its level requirement exceeds the number of available friendship bond points. You regain friendship bond points spent on an ability when it is removed. If you borrow a new ability and do not have sufficient free friendship bond points, that ability replaces abilities you previously borrowed and frees up spent points before spending them on the new ability.

The act of performing the friendship bond rite again ends any existing bonds previously formed and removes all abilities you previously borrowed, unless the same creatures are included as targets.

You gain the ability to target and bond with more creatures through the friendship bond rite (in addition to yourself) when you reach higher warlock levels: three creatures at 6th level, four creatures at 10th level, and five creatures at 14th level.

#### Vitality Pool

_6th-level Power of Friendship feature_

You gain the ability to share the load of your friends' suffering in times of need. If a bonded creature you can see within 60 feet takes damage, you can, as a Reaction, reduce the damage they take by half. You then take the same amount of damage the bonded creature took, which can't be reduced in any way. Furthermore, for the next minute, the bonded creature who took the original damage gains Resistance to a damage type of your choice that you currently resist, and you lose this Resistance.

A bonded creature who can see you and is within 60 feet of you can also make use of this feature, using their own Reaction to reduce damage you take by half, taking the same amount of damage which can't be reduced, and transferring a damage Resistance of their choice from them to you for the next minute.

Once a bonded creature uses this Reaction, they can't do so again until they finish a Long Rest.

#### Patron Tether

_10th-level Power of Friendship feature_

Your bond with your friends is strengthened, allowing for easier magical communication or transportation even when separated by great distances. If you cast a warlock spell to either send a telepathic message to a bonded creature (such as _sending_ or _telepathic bond_) or to teleport with a bonded creature or to a destination within 10 feet of a bonded creature (such as _misty step_ or _teleportation circle_), you can choose to cast the spell without expending a spell slot or material components. A bonded creature likewise can choose to cast such a spell you know without expending a spell slot or material components, as long as you are the recipient of the telepathic message (for telepathy spells) or they are teleporting with you or within 10 feet of you (for teleportation spells). Bonded creatures use your spellcasting ability modifier and Spell Save DC when casting a spell in this manner.

This feature can be used between all bonded creatures a combined number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once), and you and other bonded creatures regain all uses after you finish a Long Rest.

#### Don't You Die on Me

_14th-level Power of Friendship feature_

The tether you share with your friends allows you to pull each other back from the brink of death. As an Action, a bonded creature can touch the corpse of another bonded creature who died within the past 24 hours. The dead creature returns to life with 1 Hit Point, and any levels of Exhaustion they had are removed and transferred to the creature who used this Action, who subsequently gains an additional level of Exhaustion.

After a creature is returned to life with this feature, they cannot be targeted by this feature again for the next week.
