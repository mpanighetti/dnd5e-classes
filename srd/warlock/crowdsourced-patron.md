# Crowdsourced Patron

Some say that the path to power comes from the combined support of a sufficient throng of devoted worshippers. You know the truth: some recurring revenue also helps.

Your patrons are a collective of like-minded individuals who just want to see you succeed in your creative endeavors, and will continue to back you as long as you keep making content. Though on their own they may contain no special magical abilities or great wealth, these devotees channel their collective belief to you through a magical pact with generous membership terms and a general expectation of occasional creative output on your part.

These "backers" are largely devoted followers from other worlds and planes of existence. There's always a chance you'll encounter one in your travels, but these interactions can be a bit awkward for all parties involved.

## Crowdsourced Features

#### Patron Spells

_Crowdsourced Patron feature_

The magic of your network of patrons ensures you always have certain spells ready. You learn the _message_ cantrip if you don't already know it, and when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Crowdsourced Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Crowdsourced Spells

| Warlock Level | Spells |
|:-:|:-|
| 1 | _command, sleep_ |
| 3 | _alter self, calm emotions_ |
| 5 | _clairvoyance, sending_ |
| 7 | _compulsion, fabricate_ |
| 9 | _geas, telepathic bond_ |

#### Social Networker

_Crowdsourced Patron feature_

Your distributed network of patrons imparts their collective support to you, which fills you with confidence in your public appearances and social interactions. Choose between Persuasion or Performance. You gain Proficiency and Expertise in the chosen skill. At 6th level, you gain Proficiency and Expertise in the other skill.

Furthermore, you learn how to tap into your distributed patron network to relay your statements over great distances by word of mouth. Any Warlock spell or Warlock feature you use to communicate telepathically or remotely with another creature doubles its range limit and does not require being able to see the target or know where they are. Messages sent and received in this manner manifest as a collection of the many voices of your backers and are not recognizable as coming from you or the sender.

At 6th level, messages using this feature have no distance limit, and at 10th level, those messages additionally can be sent to other planes of existence.

#### Generous Backers

_Crowdsourced Patron feature_

You establish a system wherein your patrons can select a desired level of devotion and support. This support manifests seemingly at random, as different backers start, end, or modify their patronage.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you receive support from some of your backers by way of backer dice, represented as d4s. You receive a number of backer dice equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and at any time as a Bonus Action, you can expend a spell slot from your Pact Magic to receive another backer die. Each die has a random effect determined by rolling on the **Backer Tiers** table when received.

You can roll a backer die at any time to receive the listed effect. If you have multiple backer dice of the same tier, they can be rolled together to combine the total number rolled. Once a backer die is rolled, it is lost, as are all remaining backer dice when you finish your next Long Rest.

Your backer die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d6 at 6th level, a d8 at 10th level, and a d10 at 14th level.

##### Backer Tiers

| d10 | Tier | Effect |
|:---:|:-----|:-------|
| 1-4 | **Friendly Supporter** | When making an ability check, attack roll, or Saving Throw, roll the backer die and add the number rolled to the total. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use the backer die, but you must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. |
| 5-7 | **Street Team** | When you are forcing a creatue to make a Saving Throw against your Warlock Spell Save DC, roll the backer die and add the number rolled to the save DC. You must decide to use the backer die before the creature makes their Saving Throw. |
| 8-9 | **Devotee** | As a Bonus Action, roll the backer die and regain that number of Hit Points. If you are not missing any Hit Points, these are instead gained as Temporary Hit Points. |
| 10  | **Break the Bank** | As an action, roll the backer die. 10 times that number of gold pieces magically appear in your possession. |

#### Exclusive Podcast

_6th-level Crowdsourced Patron feature_

The combined magical fervor of your backers has granted you the ability to capture your musings in a portable vessel for their later enjoyment. For a one-hour period of a Long Rest (or the entirety of a Short Rest), you can channel your magic and cast a message into a seedpod you have in your possession to create a podcast. The podcast includes your voice and any other audible sounds that occurred nearby during the capture period. The contents of the message are entirely up to you; some creators recall their adventures from the previous day, others might conduct interviews with their party members, and still others weave fantastic fictional narratives to enthrall their audiences. Once you finish your podcast, the contents of your message are then infused within each seed in the pod. You cannot create a podcast more than once per day, as excessive content creation yields diminishing listener returns.

As an action, a creature holding the seed can squeeze it to cause the podcast's sounds to be played back. When played in this manner, the sounds and volume are reproduced exactly as you originally created them. If a creature places the seed in their ear, then the podcast can only be heard by that creature. Any words spoken during the podcast are magically translated by your patrons and can be understood by any creature that understands at least one language, and magical transcriptions appear in the air in a language the creature understands.

Any creature who listens to the entire podcast, including anyone who listened while it was created, gains Advantage on certain d20 tests as determined by the mood of the podcast, which you choose from the following options when you create it:

##### Podcast Moods

| Mood | Effect |
|:-:|:-|
| Entertaining | Advantage on Charisma checks and Saving Throws |
| Informative | Advantage on Intelligence checks and Saving Throws |
| Soothing | Resistance to the Charmed and Frightened conditions |

Starting when you reach 10th level in this class, listeners also gain Temporary Hit Points equal to a roll of your backer dice.

These effects last until the listener's next Long Rest. A creature can only benefit from each podcast message once, after which they must listen to a new podcast to benefit from this feature again.

#### Pledge Drive

_10th-level Crowdsourced Patron feature_

Beginning at 10th level, you can request direct assistance from your patrons in order to support a particular project.

Asking for aid from your patrons requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Warlock level, your patrons intervene. If your request would be aided by financial support, your patrons send you an amount of gold pieces equal to 100 Ã— the percentile number you rolled. Otherwise, the DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any Warlock spell would be appropriate.

If your patrons aid you in this manner, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a Long Rest.

At 20th level, your call for backer support succeeds automatically, though you must still roll percentile dice to determine the potential level of financial support, if any.

#### Patron-Famous

_14th-level Crowdsourced Patron feature_

Word of your exploits has spread beyond your sphere of influence to grant you an extremely minor celebrity status that you can occasionally exploit. As an action, you can attempt to sway a creature who can hear you and understand at least one language into supporting your cause. The creature must succeed on a Charisma Saving Throw against your Warlock Spell Save DC or they are Charmed by you. While Charmed in this manner, the creature becomes friendly toward you and your allies and attempts to protect you from harm, though not to the extent that they would harm their own allies or endanger themself. The Charmed condition ends if you or your allies harm the target, but otherwise lasts until you use this feature on a new target. Once a creature has been targeted by this feature, they cannot be targeted again by it for the next week.
