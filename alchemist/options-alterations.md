# Alteration Options

_2nd-level Alchemist[^ðŸ§ª] feature_

When you choose alchemist's potion alteration options, you have access to the following additional options.

##### Aged Brew

- **Materials:** an alchemist's potion that has lost potency (which isn't consumed), a bottle of wine worth 10gp
- **Alchemy Points:** 0

When spending alchemy points to refresh a potion that has lost potency, subtract 1 from the total alchemy point cost (minimum cost 1 AP). The Aged Brew alteration doesn't count against the total number of alterations applied to a potion, and it lasts until the potion loses its potency again, after which it can be reapplied to the same potion to refresh it again. After you use this alteration, you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.
