# Additional Alchemist's Potions

_1st-level Alchemist[^ðŸ§ª] feature_

The potions in the following list expand the alchemist's potions list in _[Alchemist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FbBScXvWzPKRo62ZlqXcIMgUd_KPYoqCkMa2ZtYBN8c)_. The list is organized by potion size.

### Size 1

#### [Potion of Replication](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/potions/potion-of-replication.md)

_Potion (Alchemist's Potion), Size 1 Transmutation_

- **Materials:** another potion (which isn't consumed in the creation of this potion), powdered carbon worth potion size Ã— 100gp
- **Classes:** Alchemist

**Brew.** When you brew this potion, you create an exact fresh copy of the potion referenced in its materials. In order to be eligible for copying, the reference potion must either be a common potion or a size 1 alchemist's potion. You cannot use a component pouch in place of the reference potion. You don't need to be able to brew the reference potion based on your alchemist level or any subclass prerequisites in order to copy it.

A copied alchemist's potion uses your potioncraft ability as if you were the original brewer, but any brewing choices that were made in the reference potion are carried over to the copied potion.

_Upsizing._ At size 2 or bigger, you can copy an alchemist's potion of the same size, or a normal potion of a rarity matching the table below.

| Size | Potion Rarity |
|:----:|:-------------:|
|  1   |     Common    |
|  2   |    Uncommon   |
|  3   |      Rare     |
|  4   |   Very Rare   |
|  5   |   Legendary   |

**Drink or Throw.** The potion has identical effects to the reference potion.
