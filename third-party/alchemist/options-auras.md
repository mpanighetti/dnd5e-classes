### Level 3: Aura Options

_House of Adornments feature_

When you choose an aura to imbue in a gem, you have access to the following additional options.

##### Alchemical Aura

- **Duration:** same as the potion recipe

You infuse a gem with the chemical essence of a potion recipe you know that creates an area of effect when thrown. When the aura is activated, the gem applies the throw effect of the potion recipe to the area around the gem for the potion’s duration, replacing the potion’s original splash area with the aura’s radius. If the potion’s throw effect requires targeting a creature, the gem’s holder is used as the target, but no attack roll is required; any effect on a hit applies automatically.

Infusing a gem with a potion recipe requires spending a number of alchemy points equal to the potion’s cost. Additional alchemy points can be spent to upsize the potion effects or to apply a compatible alteration, imparting the same benefits to the gem aura when activated.

Potion effects applied to gem auras follow all normal rules for potion brewing, including material component cost, upsizing limitations, and alteration prerequisites.
