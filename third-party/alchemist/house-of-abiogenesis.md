# House of Abiogenesis

On most worlds, the chemical and electrical interactions that resulted in the first spark of life is a secret lost to time, but practitioners of abiogenesis alchemy have learned how to reproduce this spark, creating new life from nonliving materials. Alchemists who have perfected this technique can augment their creations with powerful abilities using their potioncraft.

#### Abiogenesis Elixir

Your study of chemistry has granted you knowledge of the secret of abiogenesis, allowing you to grant life to nonliving substances. You learn the **[Potion of Life](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/potions/potion-of-life.md)** recipe.

#### Level 7: Unnatural Strength

Your Potion of Life grants increased potency to the creatures it creates. An [alchemist's monster](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/special/alchemists-monster.md) you create has Advantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength Saving Throws, counts as one size larger when determining its carrying capacity and the weight it can push, drag, or lift, and deals an additional 1d6 alchemical damage per size category above Small on any attack it makes.

#### Level 11: Monstrous Synergy

You have furthered your studies of creating life from nonlife, revealing methods of improving potioncraft imbibed by your creations. An alchemist's monster you create can now be under the non-instantaneous effects of two alchemist's potions at the same time.

Additionally, when you create an alchemist's monster, it optionally gains the drink effect of the Potion of Life based on the potion's size. For the duration, the Potion of Life's Elemental or Ooze creature type is applied as a second creature type in addition to the monster's normal type, instead of replacing it. The monster gains the traits of both of its creature types, and you can command the monster to shift its alchemical damage type between its two options at the start of each of your turns.

#### Level 15: Lifeblood Transfusion

The unnatural creature you have created can tap into its inner bodily reserves to convert itself into a potion as a self-sacrifice. As a Magic action, you can command your alchemist's monster to produce an alchemist's potion from its body, without spending alchemy points and with the monster's body satisfying any costly or consumed material component requirements. The potion can be any recipe that you are able to brew based on your alchemist level, and the potion size is the same as the size that was used to create the alchemist's monster. Additionally, when a creature drinks this potion, they regain a number of Hit Points equal to the alchemist's monster's Hit Points when the new potion was created.

After your alchemist's monster creates a potion in this manner, it is immediately reduced to 0 Hit Points, and the object used in its creation is destroyed.

Once you give this command, you regain the ability to do so after you finish a Long Rest.
