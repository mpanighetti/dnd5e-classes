# Wild Composer

> You know there's rhythm all around us: the waves break in rhythm, people walk in rhythm, people breathe in rhythm, too. People work in rhythm! The whole world is made up of rhythm.

Rangers who walk the path of the Wild Composer are drawn to the innate music present in the natural world. They revel in the melody of leaves rustling in the wind like chimes, and play along as woodpeckers drum a steady beat on tall steadfast trees. To these adventurers, the wild itself has a breath and cadence that grants those who can hear it great wisdom.

#### Wild Composer Magic

_3rd-level Wild Composer feature_

You are in sync with the music of the wilds. You gain Proficiency with an instrument and a tool of your choice capable of crafting that instrument (leatherworker's tools, potter's tools, or woodworker's tools might be suitable choices). You can use instruments in which you are Proficient as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells.

Additionally, you learn _The Hawk's Call_ cantrip if you don't already know it. You also learn an additional spell of 1st level or higher when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the **Wild Composer Spells** table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

##### Wild Composer Spells
| Ranger Level | Spells |
|:-:|:-|
| 3rd  | _The Hawk's Call_, _The Lost is Found_ |
| 5th  | _Song of Discovery_ |
| 9th  | _Wind's Requiem_ |
| 13th | _Earth God's Lyric_ |
| 17th | _Song of Healing_ |

#### Music-Maker

_3rd-level Wild Composer feature_

You have learned to direct nature's song into instruments and share the gift of rhythmancy with others. As part of a Short Rest, you can use tools and cast a ranger spell using a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to craft a special magic item known as an _[instrument of the wild](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/instruments/instrument-of-the-wild.md)_. You can make any type of instrument you like using this feature, as long as your tools are capable of crafting the instrument and you have Proficiency in the tools. The design of the instrument is up to you; for example, you might carve a bone from an animal you hunted to make an ocarina. When you finish crafting the instrument, you can optionally immediately Attune to it, which doesn't count against the number of magic items you can be Attuned to at once. You can also gift your instrument to other creatures. The spell you cast to craft the instrument is added to its list of imbued spells.

An _instrument of the wild_ you create contains a number of charges equal to the spell slot level you expended for its creation. As a Magic action, you can replace a spell imbued in an _instrument of the wild_ with a ranger or rhythmancy spell you know of 1st-level or higher by expending the appropriate spell slot and channeling the spell's magic into the instrument; the number of charges then adjusts as needed to match the amount required to cast the highest-level spell the instrument possesses.

You regain the ability to craft an _instrument of the wild_ using this feature after you finish a Long Rest. You can maintain the magical properties in a number of _instruments of the wild_ equal to the highest level ranger spell you know. If you craft an _instrument of the wild_ beyond your limit, one such instrument of your choice loses all of its magical properties, becoming a mundane version of that instrument.

#### Rhythm of the World

_7th-level Wild Composer feature_

Your connection to the world's secret song strengthens. While you are Attuned to an _instrument of the wild_, your rhythmancy spells gain a +1 to their attack rolls and total damage rolls, and when you cast a rhythmancy spell of 1st-level or higher, you can expend one of the instrument's charges to cast the spell at one level higher than the original spell level; for example, casting a 1st-level rhythmancy spell and expending a charge would cast that spell at 2nd-level.

Additionally, as a Magic action, you can expend one ranger spell slot of any level to tap into the music of an unfamiliar environment and learn its underlying structure. For 1 hour per level of the spell slot you expend, or until you end concentration or leave this environment, the environment is considered to be your favored terrain, or if you do not have a ranger feature that grants benefits while in your favored terrain, you instead gain temporary Proficiency and Expertise in Intelligence and Wisdom checks you make related to the terrain.

#### Song of Leaf and Claw

_11th-level Wild Composer feature_

Your ear for the songs of the natural world allows you to channel your magic through that musical structure. While you are Attuned to an _instrument of the wild_, you can expend the instrument's charges to cast ranger spells you know as if they are rhythmancy spells. When you cast _animal friendship_, _beast bond_, _locate animals or plants_, _speak with animals_, or _speak with plants_ in this manner, the charge cost is reduced by 1.

In addition, when you cast a rhythmancy spell with a casting time of 1 Action, you can make a melee or ranged weapon attack as a Bonus Action.

#### World Strider

_15th-level Wild Composer feature_

You recall every tree you have encountered, and can travel through the world's root systems to be reunited with them at a moment's notice. You learn the _tree stride_ spell, and you can cast it by expending a 4th-level spell slot. At 17th-level, you learn the _transport via plants_ spell as a ranger spell, and you can cast it by expending a 5th-level spell slot. These spells don't count against the number of ranger spells you know.
