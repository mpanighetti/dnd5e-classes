# City Dweller

You have developed an innate talent to navigate the civilized world as easily as the natural world. To you, towering buildings and bustling city streets are your forests and rivers, and crowds of people can be navigated or influenced like animal herds.

## City Dweller Features

#### City Dweller Spells

_3rd-level City Dweller feature_

When you reach certain levels in this class, you pick an additional spell of 1st level or higher to learn from the City Dweller Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesnâ€™t count against the number of ranger spells you know. Spells marked with a pager emoji ðŸ“Ÿ are from _[Unearthed Arcana: Modern Magic](https://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/UA_ModernMagic.pdf)_ and require approval from the Dungeon Master to be made available to you.

##### City Dweller Spells

| Ranger Level |Spells |
|:-:|:-|
| 3rd | _disguise self, grease, illusory script, silent image_ |
| 5th | _alter self, arcane lock, darkness, enthrall, find vehicle ðŸ“Ÿ, hold person, knock, suggestion_ |
| 9th | _create food and water, fear, haste, hypnotic pattern, major image, sending, slow, tiny hut, tongues_ |
| 13th | _arcane eye, compulsion, confusion, fabricate, private sanctum, protection from ballistics ðŸ“Ÿ, synchronicity_ ðŸ“Ÿ |

When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with a spell from the City Dweller Spells table, which must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### City Dweller Cantrips

_3rd-level City Dweller feature_

You learn the _friends_ and _message_ cantrips. These cantrips gain bolstered effects in certain social interactions:

_**Frenemies.**_ When you cast _friends_ directed at a favored enemy:

- The spell's components are replaced with a verbal component concealed within the normal conversation you carry out with the creature targeted by the spell.
- The spell's duration extends to up to 1 hour.
- When the spell ends, you can use your quick wit and sharp tongue to attempt to distract the targeted creature from your magical influence. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or they do not become hostile and are not aware that you used magic on them.


_**Instant Message.**_ When you cast _message_ while in your favored terrain:

- The cantrip's range extends to the limits of the terrain.
- You do not need to know the direction of your target.

You can cast a cantrip using these bolstered spell effects a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), and you regain all uses after completing a long rest.

#### People Person

_3rd-level City Dweller feature_

Your time spent living amongst the people of the civilized world has made you exceptionally talented at working with them â€” and against them. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check while interacting socially with a favored enemy, your proficiency bonus is doubled.

You are also adept at anticipating the next moves of the city folk you know so well. You gain one city or one humanoid lineage of your choice as a favored enemy using the ranger's Favored Enemy feature and learn an associated language. Whenever you select additional favored enemies at later levels, you select an additional city or humanoid lineage and learn an additional associated language.

#### Verticality

_7th-level City Dweller feature_

You are as familiar with a city's rooftops as you are the surface streets. You gain a climbing speed equal to your normal movement speed, or if you already have a climbing speed, it is instead increased by 10 feet.

Additionally, while you are in your favored terrain, as an action, you can jump up to twice your movement speed without spending movement. You can use this action a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum 1), and you regain all uses after completing a long rest.

#### Crowdsurfer

_11th-level City Dweller feature_

You have a preternatural ability to match pace with the hustle and bustle of busy city life. While in a crowd of people, you gain the following benefits:

- Your speed cannot be reduced by nonmagical means.
- The crowd grants you half cover and is considered difficult terrain for creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you.
- You can use your Hide in Plain Sight feature while concealed by the crowd. When the feature is used in this manner, hiding in the crowd only takes a bonus action (rather than 1 minute), you do not require camouflage materials, and you can move normally without revealing your location as long as you remain in the crowd.
- As a reaction to another creature in the crowd attacking you or an ally, you can attempt to influence the crowd's movement to disrupt the attack. The attacker must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or fall prone, causing their attack to miss. If you are hidden in the crowd, the attacker has disadvantage on their saving throw.

#### Rhythm of the City

_15th-level City Dweller feature_

While you are in your favored terrain and not incapacitated, you gain the following benefits in combat:

- You have advantage on initiative rolls.
- You are immune to the Surprised condition.
- You can take an additional action on your first turn of combat. If you cast a spell using this action, you are not prevented from casting another leveled spell on this turn.
