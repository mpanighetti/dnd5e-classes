# Favored Enemy Options

_1st-level Ranger feature_

When you choose a favored enemy, the following enemies are added to your list of options.

#### City Denizens

This option adds the citizenry of a specific city as one of the selectable favored enemy types in the ranger's Favored Enemy feature. With the Dungeon Master's consent, you can select the people of one city any time you would normally select a humanoid species as a favored enemy, since two members of the same intelligent species do not necessarily have shared mannerisms or behaviors that a hunter could specialize in, whereas a city's denizens fall into identifiable rhythms and patterns that a people-watcher could readily pick up on.

The pace and flow of a life in any two cities are sufficiently different that people from each city would be considered separate favored enemies. This means that you can identify people who hail from your favored enemy city even if you find them in another location.
