# dnd5e-classes

## Compatibility

This work is compatible with Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. It makes the following modifications from _Systems Reference Document 5.1_ and _5.2_:

- To ensure compatibility with characters created using either _Systems Reference Document 5.1_ or _5.2_, base-level class and subclass features in this document do not include a level requirement, unless they have additional feature dependencies. You gain such features as soon as you select the corresponding class or subclass.
- "Species" is used in place of "race". "Ancestry" or "variant" is used in place of "subrace".
- This document uses new traits called **Condition Resistance** and **Condition Vulnerability**. Resistance to a condition means that a creature has Advantage on saving throws made to resist that condition, and vulnerability to a condition means that a creature has Disadvantage on such saving throws.
- Damage and condition resistances, vulnerabilities, and immunities are grouped together in features and stat blocks as **Resistances**, **Vulnerabilities**, and **Immunities** respectively.
- Resistance, vulnerability, and immunity to Poison apply to both the damage type and the Poisoned condition.
- This document offers new options for the Alchemist class by balab.
